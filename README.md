# wp-sqrl
A WordPress plugin for GRC's SQRL authentication.

## Discontinued
I have discontinued work on this as Daniel Persson (kalaspuffar) over on the SQRL Official Forums has made great progress of his own and focus should be made on one central project. You can find it here: https://sqrl.grc.com/forums/wordpress-plug-in.48/
